# Sentiment-Analysis-CNN-LSTM

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, plays a crucial role in understanding public perception towards various entities, 
such as products, services, or social trends. This research paper explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in sentiment analysis. 
By combining the performance of these two deep learning architectures, we aim to evaluate their effectiveness by data cleaning in accurately classifying sentiment polarity. 
Our experimental results demonstrate the strengths and limitations of LSTM and RNN models in sentiment analysis tasks, providing valuable insights for future research and practical applications.
